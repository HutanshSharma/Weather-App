## Weather App – PyQt5 GUI with Live Weather Data
This is a modern and interactive Weather Application built using Python and PyQt5, designed to fetch and display real-time weather information from the OpenWeatherMap API. With a sleek GUI, the app allows users to input any city name and receive detailed weather data including:

Temperature in Celsius, Fahrenheit, and Kelvin

Current weather condition description

Humidity level

A visual emoji representation of the weather condition (e.g., ☀️ for sunny, ☔ for rain)

The application uses HTTP requests to pull weather data in JSON format and updates the user interface dynamically based on the response. It features a polished design with custom fonts (Lato-black.ttf), hover effects, and proper error handling for invalid inputs.
